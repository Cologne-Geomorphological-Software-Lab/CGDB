CGDB documentation
==================
The Cologne Geomorphological Database System (CGDB)  is a comprehensive information system for managing complex geoscientific research data. It is specifically designed to support small research projects that must adhere to strict data management requirements set by funding bodies but often lack the financial and human resources to do so. The framework supports the transformation of raw research data into scientific knowledge. It addresses critical challenges, such as the rapid increase in the volume, variety, and complexity of geoscientific datasets, data heterogeneity, spatial complexity, and the need to comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. The approach optimizes the research management process by enhancing scalability and enabling interdisciplinary integration. It is adaptable to evolving research requirements and supports various data types and methodological approaches, such as machine learning and deep learning, that place high demands on the data and their formats.
